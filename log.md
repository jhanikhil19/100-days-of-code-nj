# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 16, 2023 , Paderborn, DORM


**Today's Progress**: Started learning from CodewithHarry tutorials

**Thoughts:** When I sat for starting it all up. Suddenly calls and messages were coming from all my friends. And it was all without any purpose. So, I sort of shut them down and targeted to complete atleast 10 videos of the playlist. 

**Link to work:** Completed till video 10 (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agICnT8t4iYVSZ3eykIAOME)

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
