# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 16, 2023 , Paderborn, DORM


**Today's Progress**: Started learning from CodewithHarry tutorials

**Thoughts:** When I sat for starting it all up. Suddenly calls and messages were coming from all my friends. And it was all without any purpose. So, I sort of shut them down and targeted to complete atleast 10 videos of the playlist. 

**Link to work:** Completed till video 10 (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agICnT8t4iYVSZ3eykIAOME)

### Day 2: Jan 17, 2023 , Paderborn, DORM

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Dictionary, Set, Loops.

**Thoughts**: I was motivated and shared it with my friends for them to do it as well. Let's see if they work on it with me or not. I was occupied with some friends and all still finished 20 video mark at 5:15 morning. It felt good. 

**Link(s) to work**: No link for today.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
